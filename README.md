- 👋 Hi, I’m @Rickeddy-7. Im a 22 year old self-taught developer from South Africa and honestly I never really imagined myself in the tech space, let alone coding! I have, however, always been intrigued by technologies and how they work to simpliy our everyday lives.

- 👀 I’m interested in full stack development and AI. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript and C# and once i've mastered them i'll then move onto others like Swift, R and Kotlin.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects of all natures, a good developer always looks to expand his skills and grow!
