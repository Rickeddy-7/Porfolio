                    <h3>Systems Development</h3>
                    <p>WeThinkCode_ is a coding bootcamp focused on addressing the shortage of tech skills in South Africa.
                    I learnt fundamental programming skills and applied them practically through projects. It is here that I 
                    was introduced to programming concepts like TDD(test driven development), OOP(Object-Oriented Programming),
                     Parallel computing (multithreading), Client-Server Architecture, APIs, Containerisation and Quality Assurance.
                    In the first year, we are taugh the fundamentals of prgramming in Python and we build projects that we submit
                     using gitlab to solidify the knowledge. In the second year we work in teams to simulate a real-world development
                     team and collaborate to build projects in Java to learn more complex topics system design and brownfields
                     development(working with existing code and infrastructure)</p>

                    <h3>Data Science</h3>
                    <p>ALx in partnership with ExploreAI offered a 14-month data science bootcamp to equip students with 
                        the fundamental skills required for a successful career in data. The rigorous curriculum was offered by 
                        ExploreAI and covered everything from spreadsheets, data visualisation and statistics, all the way to machine 
                        learing and predictive analysis. This course also introduced important data concepts like database normalisation
                         and the 5 Vs of data.</p>

                    <h3>Systems Developer Intern</h3>
                    <p>In my role as a systems developer I formed part of a team that looks after all the systems that the school uses
                        for its day-to-day operations. My responsibilities include maintaining and troubleshooting the codebase of the 
                        internal scripts that run backups, integrating new and existing systems with other new or existing systems,
                        manage system queries from the whole organisation through our ticketing system, testing software for quality assurance,
                        and writing scripts to perform ad-hoc tasks for BAU.
                        I also worked with data to develop reports in PowerBI and built pipelines to automate this process. I also ran analyses on 
                        the businesses customer data to identify anomalies and ensure data integrity.
